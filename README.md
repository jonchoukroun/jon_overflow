# SoCal Kin
### Community based questions to local answers
# 

Built using Ruby on Rails, this clone of Stack Overflow is my first complete web application. 
# 
SoCal Kin allows users to pose questions, which are ranked by the number of answers they receive. Users can also 'agree' or 'disagree' with answers, bumping those with greater net scores to the top of the page.
